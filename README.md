Book Keeping Accounting Software

This project is a full-stack book keeping accounting application designed to help small businesses manage their financial operations efficiently. The system supports core accounting workflows including journal entries, invoices, payments, and financial reporting, with a focus on accuracy, scalability, and clean architecture.

The backend is built with Spring Boot (RESTful APIs, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL/MySQL) and follows industry best practices such as layered architecture, DTOs, validation, and proper error handling. The frontend (React) consumes these APIs to provide a responsive and intuitive user experience.

Key features include:

Journal entries with debit/credit validation

Invoice creation and tracking

Payment recording and reconciliation

Company-based data isolation (multi-tenant ready)

RESTful API design with clean domain models

Secure and scalable backend architecture

This project demonstrates practical accounting logic, backend system design, and real-world software engineering practices, making it suitable for production-level use and further extension (e.g., payroll, reporting dashboards, ACH integrations).
